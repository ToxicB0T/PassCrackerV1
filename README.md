# 🚀 Project Spotlight: PassCrackerV1 - Python Password Cracking Tool 🚀

PassCrackerV1 is a Python-based password-cracking tool that showcases both brute-force and hash-cracking techniques, specifically designed to work with MD5 hashes.

## 🔍 Features:
- **Brute Force Mode**: Iterates through possible character combinations until the target password is cracked.
- **Hash Cracking Mode**: Uses a wordlist to crack hashed passwords, simulating realistic password-cracking scenarios.
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Includes a timer to measure cracking attempts, giving insights into the time required for different methods and password complexities.

## 💡 Why I Built It
This project was a hands-on way to explore the importance of password complexity in cybersecurity. It helped me deepen my understanding of hashing algorithms and the limitations of brute-force techniques.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the script with either the brute-force or hash-cracking mode.
3. For hash cracking, include your wordlist as needed.
